# CC BACKEND TASK 2
## Akshat Ranjan


## How to run
task_a.py works using pokemon.txt and will generate the required json file for task A , it will take the command line argument for the filename and if no argument is there
the file will be named pokemon_output.json

task_b.py will generate the type matchup table, print it, and save it as a .csv file.
If the json file doesn't exist or you want to see it create it again , please uncomment line 43

api.py is to start the localhost server using flask. This file requires the .json file generated via task_b.py so please do that first
